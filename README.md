# disclaimer

this software is free and open source. and is in development. it may event not
start at all. feel free to share your skill with me if you expect it to
be usefull for you

# goal

the main goal of this project is to create a real opensource alternative
to all unusable software where we see that if the devs used it, it should be
more instinctive by far.

the mising step of these all is their bad structure. by making a web first
app, openhedgehog is meant to be compatible with mobile app at first. be
fast and give you the feature you need from anywhere.
